  Tested Counter 1 modes on oscilloscope

  Pin actions can be grouped to ((Set Clear) (Toggle)).
  For Fast PWM To 255 meanings of Set and Clear are swapped.

                   S C T  S C T
  Count to 255     - - X  - - X
  Count to A       - - X  - - X
  Fast PWM to 255  X X -  X X -
  Fast PWM to A    - - X  X X -
  PWM to 255       // Not tested. Assume as PWM to A
  PWM to A         - - X  X↔X -

  I'm not going to develop this module further

  With all that weirdness it's no longer comfortable to directly
  use it for time tracking, PWM and servos.

  I already have some and will develop specialized modules for that.

  I like module design. Problem is that hardware is too weird.
  To deal with it we need to write specialized code.
  Specialized code means additional types for area concepts.
  My modules try to be limited but exhaustive.
  So that extensions do not belong here.
