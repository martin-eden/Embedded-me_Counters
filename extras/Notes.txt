  Tested Counter 1 modes on oscilloscope

  Pin actions can be grouped to ((Set Clear) (Toggle)).
  For Fast PWM To 255 meanings of Set and Clear are swapped.

                   S C T  S C T
  Count to 255     - - X  - - X
  Count to A       - - X  - - X
  Fast PWM to 255  X X -  X X -
  Fast PWM to A    - - X  X X -
  PWM to 255       // Not tested. Assume as PWM to A
  PWM to A         - - X  X↔X -

  I'm not going to develop this module further

  With all that weirdness it's no longer comfortable to directly
  use it for time tracking, PWM and servos.

  I already have some and will develop specialized modules for that.

  I like module design. Problem is that hardware is too weird.
  To deal with it we need to write specialized code.
  Specialized code means additional types for area concepts.
  My modules try to be limited but exhaustive.
  So that extensions do not belong here.

  Unifying abstractions layer

  I am thinking about it. Point is that caller needs not know what
  exact counter it uses. Something like "give me counter for
  period of five-seconds with millisecond precision".

  But my code does not need this. It's hardwired to custom counter it
  likes. And where that counter selection decision-making code should
  be? It's operation system land. I'm not interested in writing OS
  just for my programs.

  Still, there is problem of "what is the one microsecond?".
  Because counters just count ticks. And they store them as number of
  batches. And batch size is like one or 8 or 1024 ticks. And available
  batch sizes are generally counter-specific.

  That's essential because we have function that converts between
  number of batches and human seconds. But it needs to know counter
  specifications for that.
